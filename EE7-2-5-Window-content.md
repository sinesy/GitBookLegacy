# Window content

In general, a window is composed of these parts:  
a series of buttons viewed on the topbar, which usually contains the standard buttons needed to manage the CRUD operations on a grid of detail form \(CRUD = create, retrieve, update, delete\). For example:

panels:

* a single panel \(e.g. a grid or a scrollable form or a map\) in case of a smartphone device; 
* a filter panel for the grid content is accessible through a filter button located on the topbar, which allows to open a filter child window to manage filter conditions; similarly, when the user presses on the code selector button, this will open a popup window showing a list of codes, so that the user can select one of them and automatically the code will be reported in the code selector field;
* multiple panels in case of tablet devices \(like a filter, grid, detail scrollable form\)
