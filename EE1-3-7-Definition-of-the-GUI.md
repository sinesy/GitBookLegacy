# Definition of the GUI

The final step when creating applications connected to Alfresco is the GUI.  
When objects and business components have been created, you can use the New Window functionality available in the App Designer to create windows containing grids or forms connected to Alfresco CMS.  
Each row in a grid represents a documents stored in Alfresco: the row content is the metadata values stored along with the document. There is always a file name, file type, the folder.  
You can change the metadata values directly in grid or through a form, according to the settings of the grid/form and according to the authorizations given to a specific user \(can insert, edit, delete\).  
The document can be accessed through the button upload/download, which allows to

* see a preview of the document \(or a download window will be prompt if the browser is not able to view the document, if a plugin is not available for the specific document format\)
* download the document
* upload a new version of the document
* see the document versions: for each of them it is possible to download/preview the corresponding document version.
