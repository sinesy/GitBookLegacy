Suppose you have a window containing a grid and you want to open another window when double clicking on a row of the grid.
You can do that manually, by binding to the "row double click" event of the grid a javascript action containing js code to open a second window. You can use a wizard available in the grid panel definition to generate the same settings automatically.
A few wizards are available in the settings panel for a grid in the App Designer. One of these wizards is about "Window opening from a row double click". When selecting this item, a settings dialog is showed: once the user has selected a window, a list of required parameters is proposed on the right: these are parameters required by the selected window in order to read data correctly.
For each of them, the user has to bind a value to that parameter, which can be a constant value, a variable (such as username, current date, etc.) or a value coming from the selected row in the current grid.
In this way, the wizard has all information needed to create a javascript action and bind it to the "double row click" event.
