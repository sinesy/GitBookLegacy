# Import the document types and aspects definitions in 4WS.Platform

Once at least a document type \(or aspect\) has been defined in a documents model, it is possible to import this definition within 4WS.Platform: the settings to include in the 4WS.Platform application properties form are:

* URI to invoke Alfresco
* Username/password to use when connecting to Alfresco \(ADMIN credentials\)
* model XML file name

Starting from these settings, 4WS.Platform is able to connect to Alfresco and retrieve all the document types and aspects defined in that model. The import task can be started from the "Add objects from Alfresco" functionality.
