You can create a SQL Template that you can apply to all automatic Business Components.
To do so, your Business Component&#8217;s Object must have the relation set.
For example: If your SQL Filter Template is based on the table  **Sub01People** , you&#8217;re going to add this filter to a component based on the table  **Sub02Subjects ** first, and then you must define the relation between these two tables in the  **Sub02Subjects**  ** ** object.

Then you can define a template in "SQL Filter Template"

and in a Business Component detail you can add the template

and complete the variables association with the selected fields or application params.
