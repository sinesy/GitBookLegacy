**Alternative panels**  
This container allows to include any number of sub-panels, but only one at a time is shown. All the others can be shown alternatively. The only way to select which sub-panel to show is by using javascript. Consequently, you have to set a GUI event \(e.g. a button click\) and link to it a client-side javascript action, through which selecting the sub-panel to make visible.  
The javascript method you can use to set the sub-panel to show is:  
setActiveItem\(yourPanelContainerId,subPanelIndex\);
