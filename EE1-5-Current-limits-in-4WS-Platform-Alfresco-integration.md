Not all the features provided by the Alfresco Admin Console have been reported in 4WS.Platform: only the most common are available.
There are a few limits in 4WS.Platform in terms of supported features:

* no relations are direcly supported in 4WS.Platform GUI, so you should avoid using them
* the sorting feature cannot be defined from the document type/aspect wizard: if you need to declare that a property is sortable, this must be done starting from the XML model file
