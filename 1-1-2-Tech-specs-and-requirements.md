The App Designer and Web Interpreter are a unique web application based on the following technologies:
 **JPA (Java Persistence API) ** &#8211; a part of the standard JEE 5 and 6 specifications, used to map a relational database to an object model (ORM); the App Designer has been developed using this technology for the data access layer
 **JDBC**  &#8211; a part of the Java specifications, used to access a relational database through a JDBC driver, using the SQL language to enquiry data
 **EJB or Java Beans ** &#8211; 4WS.Platform has been designed to work with an EJB container included with any JEE A.S. as well as with a simple web container such as Apache Tomcat; the business components have been written as EJB Session Bean stateless, so that they can be run inside the EJB container; 4WS.Platform provides also a special "container", a sort of basic EJB container that allows to run the same components without an EJB container: in this way it can be run within a light web container, like Tomcat; this represents the default configuration of 4WS.Platform
 **JAX-RS (Java Restful API) &#8211; ** a standard layer provided with JEE 6, used to create Restful web services using JSON format to communicate with the GUI; these web services are a sort of "bridge" between the business components and the GUI; an additional perk is that they can be accessed by other applications too, so they are a sort of SOA based solution
 **ExtJS &#8211; ** this is probably the best GUI web solution available nowadays: it provides a rich set of Ajax components, including grids, forms, trees and a plethora of many other advanced components; both the App Designer and the Web Interpreter use this software layer along with Warp.ExtJS, to create the GUI.
