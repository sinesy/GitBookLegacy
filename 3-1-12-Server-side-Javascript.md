# Server-side Javascript

You can find the complete reference about server-side Javascript in the API Documentation, through this [link](https://4wsplatform.gitbooks.io/api/content/Email.html "link")



By and large, a server-side javascript action \(or GAE action\) allows to access to all resources provided by the server, including:

* database
* NoSQL database
* web services
* local or on the cloud file system

The editor is the same for all javascript actions and it provides:

* syntax checker
* line number
* syntax highlithers
* **auto completion function**, accessible by typing a few character and then pressing CTRL+space \(or COMMAND+space\); this feature shows all compatible predefined functions provided by Platform
* **code generator which provides javascript code for an object** \(data model\) definition, in terms of attributes, accessible by pressing CTRL+I \(or COMMAND+I\); this command prompts the user with a dialog reporting all defined data models: once selected one the corresponding attribute definition is pasted within the js editor.
