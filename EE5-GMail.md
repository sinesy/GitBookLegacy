# GMail

The GMail integration in 4WS.Platform EE lets the application developer implement Javascript actions that send email with GMail APIs. The main difference between this approach and the usage of GMail as authenticated SMTP server is that the sent mail is stored in the sender’s mailbox, in the outgoing messages folder.  
 **NOTE** : to make this function work properly the e-mail field of the user \(see the 4ws.Platform user management UI\) MUST be filled with the correct address that corresponds to the Google Apps for Work account.  
In order to use this feature, you have also to define a few parameters in 4WS.Platform:

* GOOGLE\_SERVACC\_EMAIL
* GOOGLE\_SERVACC\_KEY

to enable the Google Apps integration and the sending address must correspond to a Google Apps user.

#### Syntax

```js
utils.sendGmail(from, to, subject, body, isHtmlContent, zipFiles, deleteFilesAfterSending, filesToAttach)
```
