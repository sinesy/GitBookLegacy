Once logged on into the App Designer application, the user can access to a series of functionalities, organized in a tab + tree menu. The tab menu contains three main items:

* Application Management
* Data Model
* Administration

This menu organization groups functionalities per topic, according to the MVC paradigm. 

*  **Application Management**  tab contains all functionalities related to the Views creation, including how to use them (events, actions, etc.).
*  **Data Model**  includes functionalities used to define data models, relations, business components to fetch data and store them.
*  **Administration**  allows to define users, roles, user-roles associations and other administration features.

The rest of this chapter describes in detail each of these functionalities provided by the App Designer Menu.
