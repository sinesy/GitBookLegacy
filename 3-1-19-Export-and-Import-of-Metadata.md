4WS.Platform makes it easy to move application metadata from one installation to another one: in this way the application configured in a development environment can be imported in the test or production environments as a simple .zip file.
In order to do it, you can use the Application -&gt; Import/Export application functionality. This feature allows to export metadata from an environment and import metadata to another installation of 4WS.Platform.

* Metadata Application Management
