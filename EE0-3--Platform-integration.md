Activiti is composed of two distinct web applications: Activiti Rest and Activiti Explorer. The first application is the  **BPMN engine** . Platform is fully integrated with the engine: there is no need to work with this application in any way, since Platform provides a user interface to communicate with the engine and manage processes.
The latter provides a  **graphical web modeler**  to define BPMN processes. Again, Plarform embeds this system and allows users to work only with a single user interface, the one provided by Platform.

Platform Web Designer includes 4 functionities in the Administration -> Activiti menu:
Processes and models
Process instances
To do list
Process history

Each of these menus are described in detail in the following sections.
