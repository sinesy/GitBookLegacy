# SSO - Authentication

4WS.Platform supports external/SSO/federated SSO authentication mechanisms, that hold usernames and passwords and let the credential to be stored in a central system, without replication. Anyway, to make 4WS.Platform work correctly the users and roles must be synchronized or provisioned.  
The following authentication providers are currently available:

* [Identity management in Platform](/EE6-1--Identity-management-in-Platform.md)
* [external LDAP or Active Directory](/ldap.md)
* [Google SSO](/google-sso.md)
* [Custom SSO](/custom-sso.md)
