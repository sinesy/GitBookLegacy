Every time a process terminates, a record is created in the "Executions" list, which reports the start/end date+time, the duration of the process, the exit code and an error message, if available.
Through the "Settings" folder, it is possible to automate the cleaning up of this list, by removing the oldest recordings, according to what defined in the "Max executions" input field.
