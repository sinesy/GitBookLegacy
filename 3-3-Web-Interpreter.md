# Web Interpreter

Provided a set of metadata defined through the app designer, the interpreter is able to create the whole web tier, by dynamically creating javascript files that are loaded on the browser on demand.  
In this way the web application results to be fast to download. Restful web services and business components on the server side are interpreted as well. A change applied to metadata through the App Designer is immediately available, by simply reloading the web application. No deploy activities are required, no A.S. restarting are needed.  
Once logged on the web application, the MDI environment \(multiple device interface\) is showed: this allows to show multiple windows inside the same container, in terms of internal frames or it can show windows as tabpanels.  
The application menu is showed at a container level and can have the most common layouts:

* menubar with popup menus
* tree menu
* tabmenu with subtabs
* a combination of these ones

The other regions of the container can be customized: top bar and bottom bar can contain the typical gadgets, such as user id, environment, language, etc.  
Graphics components include editable grids, detail forms, trees, maps, image panes. These panels can be combined together to create frames to show inside the MDI container.
