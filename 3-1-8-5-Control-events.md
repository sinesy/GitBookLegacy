It is possible to add actions to perform when an event is fired in a control.
Many events are supported:

*  **focus grab and lost** 
*  **value changed**  &#8211; after losing focus on the control, if the value has changed, this event is fired; the user can link an action to execute when the event happened
*  **enable/disable a control** 
*  **before validation**  &#8211; in case of a code selector column, the user can digit a value within the cell editor and when the focus is lost, the validation would start; through this event it is possible to intercept the validation task and perform an action just before the validation process: in this way it is possible for instance to apply filtering conditions to the validation request
*  **value correctly validated**  &#8211; in case of a code selector column, the user can digit a value within the cell editor and when the focus is lost, the validation would start; through this event it is possible to intercept the outcome of the validation task, in case of valid value
*  **value not correctly validated**  &#8211; in case of a code selector column, the user can digit a value within the cell editor and when the focus is lost, the validation would start; through this event it is possible to intercept the outcome of the validation task, in case of invalid value
*  **before grid opening**  &#8211; in case of a code selector column, the user can select the code from the lookup grid; through this is event it is possible to intercept the grid opening and perform an action just before this event: in this way it is possible for instance to apply filtering conditions to the grid’s data loading request
*  **row selected**  &#8211; in case of a code selector column, the user can select the code from the lookup grid; through this is event it is possible to intercept the grid selection value.
*  **button click**  &#8211; in case of a button controls, the user can select the action to execute on click.
