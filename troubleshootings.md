# Troubleshootings

### Installation path problems

Be careful to avoid the installation of  Tomcat in paths having a space ‘‘ in folders: Windows operating system could have problems in recognizing the correct path.

---

### Installation listening port problems

Moreover, pay attention to the port configured in Tomcat: in Linux/Unix O.S. you could have to change OS settings in order to allow the use of that port by Tomcat.

In order to run Tomcat, you can execute the command tomcat/bin/catalina.sh run or catalina.bat run, according to the o.s. in use; pay attention to the fact that in Linux/Unix/MacOS o.s. you have to change the permissions for those files, in order to execute them, use the command: “chmod u=rwx \*.sh” to make these files executable.

If you have changed the HTTP port in tomcat/conf/server.xml file, the URL to use in the browser to connect to 4WS.Platform changes as well. Be careful not to use a port already used by other services. In order to check it out, open a shell and execute the command “netstat”: if a service is already using the same port, you will be see it through that command.

---

### Database connection problems

Another common problem is due to a wrong database connection configuration or because of the lack of the JDBC driver; any java program needs a JDBC driver to connect to a database. Remember to include it \(one or more .jar files\) into tomcat/lib folder. According to the database type you have chosen, you can download such a driver from the database vendor offical web site: search for JDBC driver in its web site.

In all these cases, check out the log generated by Tomcat when starting it: tomcat/logs/catalina.out or tomcat/logs/localhost.0.log

It will report any configuration error or problems like the ones described above.

---

### Execution problems

There could be problems when executing the product, due to several reasons:

**network connection problems between the web browser and the tomcat**

suggestions:

check the quality of the network between the two layers

check out the amount of data you send between the server and the client side \(e.g. the data provided to grids, lookups, remote combo boxes\); the way you configured an applicatio can have detrimental effects on the performance of the application itself

**network connection problems between Tomcat and a database server**

suggestions:

check the quality of the network between the two layers

check out if there is a firewall which could close database connections still opened after a while; Platform, as the majority of the web applications, uses a database connection pooler inside, in order to speed up the execution of the business logic; that means that these connections cannot be closed externally

check out if there is an automatism on the database server which closes connections on its side after a while

---

**memory consumption on Tomcat; there are two kinds of memories used by Tomcat: PermGen and Heap Memory. Each can be configured when defining the service which starts Tomcat or on the catalina.sh/bat o service.sh/bat files**

Typical settings for these memory are 256Mb for PermGen e 768Mb for the Heap Memory, but these should be changed according to the specific configured application.

In order to retrieve information about the current status of the web application, there is a public web service that can be invoked. This web service checks the availability of database connections to the main repository \(database\) and returns a HTTP 200 code in case fo successful test, otherwise, it returns a 500 error code + an error message reporting the cause of the problem.

Apart from the HTTP code, an HTML message is also provided, reporting times related to getting a connection and the execution time for a query: these times could be helpful to figure out if there is an overload on the database server.

The web service can be invoked through this URL:

[http://host:port/platform/healthCheck](http://host:port/platform/healthCheck)

and it could be scheduled to be executed automatically through the Platform Scheduler: a notification email could be sent in case of 500 error code, to inform a system administrator abour a problem with the application.

The web service accepts two additional parameters, in order to fetch additional information:

checkAdditionalDatasources=Y

when adding this parameter to the URL, every configured additional data source will be checked out too. Time required to get the connection is also reported.

getAdditionalInfo=Y

when adding this parameter to the URL, every System property is also reported, as well as the memory usage \(total memory, used memory, free memory\).

Example of an URL which returns a detail info about the web application status:

[http://host:port/platform/healthCheck?getAdditionalInfo=Y&checkAdditionalDatasourcesToo=Y](http://host:port/platform/healthCheck?getAdditionalInfo=Y&checkAdditionalDatasourcesToo=Y)

**network connection problems between a remote client and a Platform installation**

In case the end users report a slow performance when retrieving or sending data to a Platform server \(e.g. using a web application based on Platform or invoking web services\), the bad performance can be due to a variety of different causes, which can be sum up in:

* a slow internet connection, used by the end user
* an application functionality not optimized, in terms of memory consumption or managed data
* too many requests to the server at the same time
* a slow performance due to the server \(hardware\)
* a slow performance due to the database server used by the Platform server

Each of these potential issues must be carefully evaluated and they are discusses in detail in the next few sections.

---

**a slow internet connection, used by the end user**

It is not easy to prove that a problem resides on the poor internet connection used by the end user to communicate with the Platform server, since often this issues is temporary and it could not be identified later, when someone else is dealing with that problem and wanting to figure it out.

In order to promptly and easily facilitate the evaluation of this problem, there is a functionality available at AppDesigner level, which can be used to evaluate the client internet connection: simply go to **Help -&gt; Network Test **and a test will be automatically carried out by Platform, related to: latency, download/upload transfer rate. The outcome of this test is reported to the user a few seconds afterwards. The same results are also automatically saved by Platform in CON60\_LOGS, as an application event, which can be shown at any time using the functionality **Monitoring -&gt; Log Server -&gt; Table Logs **and choosing **Net Test** events.

It is possible to include the same network test functionality within the web application, by following these steps:

* create a client-side javascript action and include in it the instruction: 

```js
netTest();
```

* create a new menu item, using the App Designer Menu item, choosing the option "Execute action" and link to it the just created action

In this way, the Network Test functionality can be accessed by the end users, without using the AppDesigner.

There is also a third option: programmatically execute it, without a visual prompt to the user. In order to do it, just invoke the global client-side method netTest from any client-side javascript action, using the following code:

```js
var myCallbackFunction = function(latency,downloadRate,uploadRate) { 
  // latency: expressed in ms, download/uploadRate: expressed in Kb/sec
  // do something with the arguments...
}
netTest(myCallbackFunction);
```

---

**an application functionality not optimized, in terms of memory consumption or managed data**

This is probably the most difficult issue to recognize, since it is often due to a poor design activity.

A good way to identify these kind of issues is using the AppDesigner functionality named App Diagnosis, available in

**Monitoring -&gt; Application** **Log -&gt; App Analysis**

Thanks to this feature, it is possible to identify a wide range of issues, due to slow queries, too many records fetched, database connection errors, memory consumption and much more.

---

**too many requests to the server at the same time**

It is important to pay attention to the number of HTTP requests coming to the server, especially in case of many web service calls. A large number of requests could:

* saturate the network bandwidth available at server layer
* reach the maximum amount of sockets \(ports\) available at operating system level and create HTTP network errors
* reach the maximum amount of database connection and create database connection errors
* consume too much CPU on the server and consequently slow down the perfomance of the whole system

When creating web services and by and large creating a web application, it is important to pay attention to a few key elements, including: **average number of end users** connecting to the web app, average **number of web service calls per second**, **how complex the web service logic is**.

If the number of end users is higher than a hundred or the number of web service calls per second is more than a unit, it is strongly recommended to carry out a stress test, before going to production, for example by using a free tool like **Apache JMeter**.

Another option is to set up a **cluster of servers** in order to manage a wide number of connections, with **auto-scale** option if available, in order to manage peaks of connections.

It is important to execute a **fine tuning of the database **as well, in terms of **max number of concurrent connections** it can manage and optionally increase the default number, according to the number of users/web service calls. The **max nr of database connections at pooler level** can be changed as well, if needed, by editing the **c3p0.properties** file available within WEB-INF/classes folder of the Platform server installation \(the property named c3p0.maxPoolSize\) and the max time to wait for a connection \(property named c3p0.checkoutTimeout, expressed in ms\).

A good tool embedded in the App Designer to use to figure out the amount of HTTP requests coming to the server is available through **Monitoring -&gt; Application Log -&gt; Log Statistics **

where all incoming requests are reported and grouped by type and day.

Moreover, a more detail report reports the figure along the day, grouping the requests per hour of day. The same chart reports also the consumption of CPU, so it is possible to figure out how requests are affecting the CPU usage.

**a slow performance due to the server \(hardware\)**

A heavy load due to the application logic on the server obviously affects the server \(hardware\) performance. The server can be sized accordingly to the nature of the app and its complexity. If needed, a cluster of servers should be introduced.

A good approach is also to **limit the execution of enqueued elements and scheduled processed** in a dedicated server of the cluster: in this way, the performance of the on-line part of the application, accessed by the end users, would not be affected by the batch part.

---

**a slow performance due to the database server used by the Platform server**

Another typical bottleneck in a system is represented by the database: this must be carefully tuned and monitored over time.

The diagnosis tool provided by Platform \(**Monitoring -&gt; Application** **Log -&gt; App Analysis**\) is an helpful resource to use in order to recognize problems due to the database, such as:

* timeout when retrieving a database connection, often due to a pool size not correctly set and to increase, as well as the max number of connections at database level to set
* slow queries
* database locks, often due to design errors when creating the application
