## Constraints Layout

In mobile apps it is possible to define a responsive layout named Constraints Layout. This layout works:

* at control level, i.e. among graphics controls contained in filter, form and editable panels
* at container level, i.e. among panels, contained in the Constraint type Panel

The latter represents another type of panel, an alternative to a generic panel \(supporting 5 only elements inside, at north/center/south/east/west\), which allows to arrange other panels within it, in any position, by combining:

* width/height absolute values
* width/height absolute weights
* anchors to the top/left/right/bottom margin of the panel
* anchors to another panel, on the left/right/top/bottom of it
