# Adding a complex caption in the image gallery

An image gallery is a panel requiring a business component for list, used to fill the gallery from left to right, from to to bottom.  
Another mandatory field is the  **Image**  field, a field defined in the SELECT clause of the business component, used to render the image corresponding to the value for that field.  
An optional field is the  **Caption**  field, used to show a caption below the image. It works along with  **Caption Height** .  
That field can contain HTML content, used to render a complex content.  
According to the image size and row/caption height, you can create a overlapping effect between the image and the caption.
