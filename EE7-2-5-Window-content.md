In general, a window is composed of these parts:
a series of buttons viewed on the topbar, which usually contains the standard buttons needed to manage the CRUD operations on a grid of detail form (CRUD = create, retrieve, update, delete). For example:

panels:
a single panel (e.g. a grid or a scrollable form or a map) in case of a smartphone device; a filter panel for the grid content is accessible through a filter button located on the topbar, which allows to open a filter child window to manage filter conditions; similarly, when the user presses on the code selector button, this will open a popup window showing a list of codes, so that the user can select one of them and automatically the code will be reported in the code selector field;
multiple panels in case of tablet devices (like a filter, grid, detail scrollable form)
