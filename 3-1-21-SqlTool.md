# SqlTool

SqlTool is a feature available expecially for database administrators and deployers that allows to access to the database schema used by 4WS.Platform.  
These functionality provides two main features, located in two different folders: SQL Browser and SQL Shell.  
 **SQL Browser **   
In this folder the list of tables defined within the schema are showed: for each schema, several panels are available, including the  **Table Structure** , i.e. the list of columns and their properties \(column name, type, list of primary keys, mandatory columns\) and the  **Table Data** , which shows the table content.  
This grid can be easily filtered/ordered, as for any other grid of 4WS.Platform; that grid is also editable, so that it is possible to change the content of the table quickly and easily. Moreover, the grid content is loaded in block of data, so the reading time is good even with tables having a large number of records.
