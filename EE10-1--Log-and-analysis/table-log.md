## Table log

This feature is used to monitor the **table log**, i.e. server-side log stored in a table and automatically generated for specific events, like javascript or mobile errors, SMS/email sendings, etc.

It is composed of a filter panel and the results list.

Through the filter panel it is possible to limit the results list in terms of:

* message **type**
* starting from the specified **date and time**
* by **note**, i.e. the content of the message

Messages stored in this table are automatically generated by Platform and are classified by type, among one of these:

* **Javascript Error **– errors generated when executing a server-side javascript action
* **SMS **– event stored when sending an SMS
* **Email **– event stored when sending an email message
* **Mobile Error **– in case of a mobile application, this event is traced when an error happens inside the mobile device
* **Central Sync Error **– in case of a mobile application, this event is traced when an error occurs on the server-side, while sending/receiving data to/from the mobile device
* **App Analysis **– events stored when the application analysis task is executed \(every hour\). See the App Analysis section for further details.
* **Queue **– events stored when an element extracted from a queue has been processed.



When pressing the Search button, results are shown below the filter panel, according to the specified filter values.
