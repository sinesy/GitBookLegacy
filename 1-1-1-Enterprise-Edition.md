# Enterprise Edition

What just described is for free and is part of the Community Edition of 4WS.Platform.  
In addition to this open source layer, there is also an Enterprise Edition of 4WS.Platform, composed of the open source layer plus a series of enterprise level modules, that can be bought separately, if needed. These modules are:

* **Authentication module based on the LDAP protocol** ; this sub-system can synchronize with an LDAP server to copy users and roles to the local tables, so that authentication and roles definition are always up to date with the ones defined in the central LDAP server.
* **Scheduler** , in order to automatically run business components or commands to execute from the shell. Scheduling can be defined through several settings, including frequency, activation date and time, input parameters. Email notifications are also supported, according to the process exit code. Process execution history is also available and automatically cleaned up over time.
* **BPM integration** . Through the BPM graphical designer it is possible to define workflows and use them within the application, for instance to execute complex business logic at certain application events, such as before or after an insert/update/delete of a data object. This feature avoids the need for custom code to implement complex logic, that can be realized by means of a business process withing the BPM engine.
* **Advanced form designer** , used to graphically design a form, using drag ‘n drop techniques and components palette, to speed up and make it easier the development of complex forms, including folders, subfolders, subpanes.
* **Groupware module** , which consists of mail server integration, calendar \(Microsoft and Google calendars\) and activities integration, CMS integration \(Alfresco, Google Drive, embedded CMS\) for document management, including search, setting metadata, upload/download, lock/unlock and versioning.
* **Cloud extensions,**  which allow to run the product not only with an IaaS cloud solution, but also with the Google PaaS solution based on AppEngine.
* **Mobile interpreter** , a mobile app for Android and iOS platforms, which is able to interpret the metadata defined through the app designer and create mobile apps that are deployed through AppStore or Google Play once, and then easily updated any number of times, through the synchronization process supported by 4WS.Platform, which allows the transfer of metadata and data to make the mobile app always up to date.
