# User Manual

This section reports a detailed description about the two main sub-systems of 4WS.Platform: Web Designer and Web Interpreter. These two modules are available independently of the edition of the product: Community Edition or Enterprise Edition.  
The starting point for the web application is the home page, reporting always the link to the Web Designer and, below it, the list of the already defined applications. Through this menu it is possible to access to the Web Designer or to any of the interpreted applications.  
In any case, when clicking on one of these links, the Login Page is showed: once authenticated into the system, the user can access to the functionalities provided by the selected application.

Since the default authentication & authorization system is based on the module provided with 4WS.Platform, the Login Page requires 4 data: a "Company Id", a "Site Id", a "Username" and a "Password". Typically the "Company Id" and "Site Id" values are defined initially, when creating and filling out the database schema.  
There is the chance to hide them if they are not useful. Check out the "4WS schema" to find more detail information about the meaning of "Company Id" and "Site Id" and "Customize the application" about how to hide them.
