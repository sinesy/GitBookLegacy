4WS.PLATFORM IS A MODULAR PLATFORM FOR APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENTCOMPOSED OF A SET OF SUB-SYSTEMS, EACH OF THEM FOCUSED ON A SPECIFIC TOPIC: AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION, MENU&#8217;, APP DESIGNER, WEB INTERPRETER, ETC.


COMMUNITY LEVEL MODULES
Since each organization has its own identity management, 4WS.Platform has been released with a specific  **open source**   **implementation** , that can be replaced with another one. That can be done easily, due to the pluggable nature of the platform: the default identity management implementation provided with 4WS.Platform is a plugin that can be replaced with another one, created ad hoc for a specific company. The default implementation includes an authentication process based on a predefined database table. Authorizations and menu definition are managed by predefined database tables as well, that can be replaced by other implementations, if needed.
