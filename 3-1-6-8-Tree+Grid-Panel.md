# Tree + Grid Panel

This is a special type of  **read only**  panel, fed in the same way as the tree pane: a business component for a list of data must be provided, as for a tree panel, i.e. the business component should be invoked multiple times, every time a tree node is to be expanded.  
Unless the tree panel, a tree+grid panel is able to show not only one piece of data for each node, but a set of additional data can be viewed for each node, through the grid embedded in the tree: each grid row shows data related to the selected tree node.
