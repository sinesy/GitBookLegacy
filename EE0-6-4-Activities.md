This feature reports the list of tasks potentially assigned to the current user and the list of already assigned tasks.
When selecting a task from the first list (tasks potentially assigned), the user can assign to himself that task or assign it to another user compatible with that task, i.e. belonging to the same group of users potentially assigned to that task.
When selecting an already assigned task, the panel on the right will show the list of variables and let the user to set the values for those variables. 
Once completed a task, it can be closed to move forward the process execution. Another way to close a task is through other Platform functionalities, which can automatically close a task when a specific event is fired.
