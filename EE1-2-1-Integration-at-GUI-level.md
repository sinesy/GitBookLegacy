# Integration at GUI level

Platform allows to create a set of panes that compose the new web front-end of Alfresco; the construction is realized via a series of wizards through which it is possible to graphically configure lists of documents, detail panes and related metadata, search panels, document version lists, document preview and upload panes and much more, including the administration of documents, in terms of access policies, users and user groups.

These tasks can be accomplished in an easier way than with Share, without the need of expert technicians and with costs considerably lower. Mantaining this system is also cheaper and simpler, since neither external vendors are required, nor skilled developers.  
Platform is more than that: it was born as an open source tool to use to quickly create data centric web applications. Among the most important features of this product, there are wizards to create grids, trees, detail forms, Google maps, image galleries, code selectors, starting from database tables and optionally database queries expressed in the SQL language, in a way very similar to the classical Microsoft Access application, but with more strengths, like the web access and multi user capability.

All the features provided by Platform when creating a GUI starting from a database are still available when connected to Alfresco. So it is possible to include code selectors, date/date+time/time controls, as well as numeric or text fields: in this way the UI can be enhanced when compared with the basic one provided together with Alfresco Share.
