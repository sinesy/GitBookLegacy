**Generic panel**  
This container allows to include up to 5 sub-panels, each in a specific region.  
Five regions are supported:

* **top**  – a sub-panel is shown on the top of the container, having a fixed height \( **Height**  is a mandatory property for that sub-panel\); it will expand itself horizontally
* **center**  – a sub-panel is shown in the central part of the container and it will use all the available space
* **bottom**  – a sub-panel is shown on the bottom of the container, having a fixed height \( **Height**  is a mandatory property for that sub-panel\); it will expand itself horizontally
* **left**  – a sub-panel is shown on the left of the container, having a fixed width \( **Width**  is a mandatory property for that sub-panel\); it will expand itself vertically
* **right**  – a sub-panel is shown on the right of the container, having a fixed width \( **Width** is a mandatory property for that sub-panel\); it will expand itself vertically

There must be at least one sub-panel, arranged automatically in the center region.  
This is also the default layout for the window \(the root node in the tree\) and it cannot be changed.
