Every process has two mandatory elements to define: the start and end events.
Similarly to the user tasks, a start process can have input properties (called Form properties), that must be provided by the calling procedure which starts the process. 
When starting a process from 4WS.Platform, the declared input properties for the start event are reported as a Form containing graphics controls for each property, where the user can fill in and the start the process.
All these properties become process properties and consequently, they are available in any other task of the process.
