First, create a server side js action when defining the custom logic; this action receive in input the dataStoreId value (in the reqParams input object) and the current user and other user information (contained in the userInfo input object). You can use this information to decide which datasource to return back, through the setReturnValue();Additional datasource management: it is possible to define a custom logic to figure out which additional datasource to use, according to the user. For instance, if you have a table reporting a which datasource to use for each user, you can define a server-side javascript action and use it to dynamically decide the additional datasource to use.Password: Password: number of days to use for the password expiration

* Password: number of erroneous login attempts
* Order of Grid Export: ordered list of types export for grids

* Example: XLS|CSV (;)|CSV (,)|HTML|PDF|RTF|XML (small format)|XML (large format)



Second, reportÂ the action id just defined as the &#8220;Customize Datastore&#8221; application parameter.
## Example

```js
if (reqParams.dataStoreId==null || reqParams.dataStoreId==0 || reqParams.dataStoreId==-1) {
    utils.setReturnValue("");
}
else {
    var json = utils.executeQuery(
        "SELECT DATASTORE_ID FROM CON04_ADDITIONAL_DATASTORES WHERE DESCRIPTION IN "+
        "(SELECT COD_SOCIETA FROM SOCIETA WHERE USERCODE_ID=:USERNAME)",
        null,false,true,
        []
        );
    var list = eval("("+json+")");
    if (list.length==1) {
        utils.setReturnValue(list[0].datastoreId);
    }
    else {
        utils.setReturnValue("");
    }
}
```
