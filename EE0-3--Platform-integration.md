# Platform integration

Activiti is composed of two distinct web applications: Activiti Rest and Activiti Explorer. The first application is the  **BPMN engine**.

Platform is fully integrated with the engine: there is no need to work with this application in any way, since Platform provides a user interface to communicate with the engine and manage processes.  
The latter provides a  **graphical web modeler**  to define BPMN processes. Again, Platform embeds this system and allows users to work only with a single user interface, the one provided by Platform.

Platform Web Designer includes 4 functionalities in the Administration -&gt; Activiti menu:

* Processes and models
* Process instances
* To do list
* Process history

Each of these menus are described in detail in the following sections.
