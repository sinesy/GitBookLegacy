# Process input parameters

Optionally, a process definition can include one or more input parameters.  
Typically, these parameters should have a text type, as for a shell command. There could be some cases where a different type can be needed, as for a Java Business component, where a Java programmer could declare different input types \(e.g. Number, Date,â€¦\).

For this reason, for each parameter a "Type" must be defined. Supported types are: Text, Number, Date and Date+time.  
According to the selected type, a value must be filled in: the columns "Text", "Number", "Date/Date time" can be used alternativelly, with regards to the parameter type.  
The "Description" column is not actually used by the process: it is only provides a description within the scheduled process, to make it easy to figure out the meaning of that parameter.
