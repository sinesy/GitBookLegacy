# Buttons

Buttons can be added to the toolbar included on the top of a grid or a detail form. In the detail window related to grids or forms, there is a special folder named "Buttons" that allows to insert, edit, delete custom buttons.  
For each of these buttons, an action can be called when the user presses the button.  
Apart from the action binded to the button, there are other properties that can be defined when creating a button:

* text for the button
* button icon
* position of the button inside the toolbar
* flag used to the way the action is invoked: synchronous or asynchronous
* flag used to enable the button only when the component \(grid/form\) is in insert mode
* flag used to enable the button only when the component \(grid/form\) is in edit mode
* flag used to enable the button only when the component \(grid/form\) is in readonly mode

Through buttons it is possible to open windows from parent windows, execute business logic on the server side, perform other presentation logic, through actions, expressed as javascript, SQL statements, web services.
