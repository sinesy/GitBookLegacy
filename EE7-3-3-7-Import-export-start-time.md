# Import-export start time and wait time

### Import-export start time

This is an optional field:  
if specified, it represents the date+time when all the writing/import/reading/export data process must be carried out. It is used together with the "Imp/exp data wait time".  
if not specified, the current data+time is used instead, that is to say, all processes will be executed when the web application is started.
