When creating a new process, this folder contains all required data.
The other folders are not essential when defining a working process.
Required data change according to the " **Execution Type** " chosen. There are several supported execution types:
 **Server-side Javascript**  &#8211; once a server-side javascript action has been defined, it is possible to select it and schedule its execution; the input field named "Command to run" will change content according to the selected execution type: in case of "Server-side Javascript", a combobox is showed, containing all server-side javascript actions
 **Custom Java Business component**  &#8211; when a job to execute is particularly complex, the only feasible scenario could be to develop a program; since Platform has been written in Java, the program must be written in Java too; when selecting this item, the "Command to run" input field allows to type the Java class name (package included)
 **Shell execution ** &#8211; when choosing this option, the "Command to run" input field is related to a command to execute from shell, which can be filled in also by pressing the button on the right of the input field, which shows the server file system, so the user can choose a specific file to execute.
Please take note that if you want to execute a command from shell, this command must be phisically stored in the Platform server file system, NOT in the file system of your PC!
Moreover, if the Platform server is running Windows, then the command must be an executable file, such as .exe, .bat, whereas in case of Linux/Unix/MacOS, the command must be a .sh file and it must be "executable" (e.g. chmod u=rwx *.sh).

 **Grid Data Import ** &#8211; Platform supports the data import for a grid; after defining the data import task (through "Configure Import file"), you can select this option: from the "Command to run" combobox, you can select one of the configured data import tasks.
Please note that this setting is not enough to run successfully this kind of batch: the file name to read must be specified as a process parameter, otherwise the process execution would fail. See the "How to define a Grid Data Import" section for mofe details.
 **Synchronize users ** &#8211; Another common task that can be helpful to automate is the synchronization of users/groups coming from an external authentication server, such as an LDAP.
Before using this option, Platform must have been already configured to synxhronize users and/or groups from external systems.
When choosing this setting, the "Command to run" is automatically set to "http[s]://&lt;platform_domain&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;context&gt;/secursync" (for example http://localhost:8080/platform/securSync), which is the web service to invoke in order to manually start the sync process.
Actually, this setting allows to run any kind of web service, not only the "sync users" default web service.
When automating the execution of a process, two data must be provided:
 **scheduling**  &#8211; execution frequency, i.e. the measure unit to use when automating the process start: it can be expressed in minutes (minumum value: 2 minutes), days, months and "end month".
The latter choice, "End month", means that the process will be automatically started every month, the last day of the month.
 **frequency**  &#8211; number of executions per measure unit; for instance, the value "5", combined with "minutes", means that the process will be executed every "5 minutes"
The combination of this two sizes allows to define how often to execute the process.
 **Start day/time**  &#8211; this combination defines when the process will start to execute: that day at that time; after that time, ther execution will be automatically restarted according to the scheduling+frequency.
 **Max executions**  &#8211; maximum number of executions before cleaning up the old recordings of previous executions, showing in the "Executions" folder.
 **Username**  &#8211; optional input field, used to specify a username to use when executing the process; this could be needed in some processes where there is a business logic based on a specific user.
 **Suspended**  &#8211; flag used to suspend the automatic execution of the process: when selected, the process will no more autostarted; the manual execution is still allowed, by pressing the "Start process" button.
