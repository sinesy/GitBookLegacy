# Web Interpreter

PROVIDED A SET OF METADATA DEFINED THROUGH THE APP DESIGNER, THE INTERPRETER IS ABLE TO CREATE THE WHOLE WEB TIER, BY DYNAMICALLY CREATE JAVASCRIPT FILES THAT ARE LOADED ON THE BROWSER ON DEMAND. IN THIS WAY THE WEB APPLICATION RESULTS TO BE FAST TO DOWNLOAD.

* **Restful web services**  and  **business components**  on the server side are interpreted as well. A change applied to metadata through the app designer is immediately available, by simply reloading the web application. No deploy activities are required, no A.S. restarting are needed.
* Once logged on the web application, the  **MDI environment**  \(multiple device interface\) is showed: this allows to show multiple windows inside the same container, as internal frames or as tabpanes.
* The  **application menu**  is showed at container level and can have the most common layouts: menubar with popup menus, tree menus, tabmenus with subtabs or a combination of these ones. It can fit any need!

* The other regions of the container can be customized: top bar and bottom bar can contain the typical gadgets, such as user id, environment, language, etc.
* **Graphics components**  include editable grids, detail forms, trees, maps, image panes. These panels can be combined together to create frames to show inside the MDI container.
