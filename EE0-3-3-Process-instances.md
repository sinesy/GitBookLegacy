# Process instances

This menu item opens a window displaying the list of process instances currently running.  
Since the number of instances for all the processes and process versions can be huge, there are two lists within this window:  


* a process list, where all processes are reported
* a process instances list

When opening the window, all instances of all processes are showed in the second list.  
If the user selects a specific process in the first list, the second list is filtered by the first one.

On the right side of the window, the instance detail is reported:

* a graphical representation of the process instance, where the current running activity is highlighted
* details about the instance properties and completed tasks are reported as well.
