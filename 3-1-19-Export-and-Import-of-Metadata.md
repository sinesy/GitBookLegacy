# Export and Import of Metadata

4WS.Platform makes it easy to move application metadata from one installation to another one: in this way the application configured in a development environment can be imported in the test or production environments as a simple .zip file.  
In order to do it, you can use the Application -&gt; Import/Export application functionality. This feature allows to export metadata from an environment and import metadata to another installation of 4WS.Platform.

This feature is divided in two parts:

* File management \(previous page\)
* Metadata Application Management \(next page\)
