# Custom theme editor

Through the App Designer, it is possible to define a custom theme for the mobile app. The custom theme editor can be accessed starting from the application detail window.  
The editor allows to define colors and fonts at a global level: these settings are then valid fot all the grids and forms. Some of these colors/font can be personalized at grid/form level, for a specific grid.
