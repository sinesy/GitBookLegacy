# Email notifications

It is optionally possible to define one or more email addresses which will receive an email notification at the end of the process; the email message will be send according to the exit code of the terminated process.  
Consequently, it is possible to capture only some exit codes, related for instance to error conditions, and for each of them send an ad hoc email message. The"Email address" cell can contain a list of email addresses, separated by a comma \(,\) and all of these addresses will receive the same email message, containing the name of the process just finished, the starting/ending date+time and the exit code + error message, if available.
