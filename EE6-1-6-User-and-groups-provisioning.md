# User and groups provisioning

When used in conjunction with an external authentication system \(external SSO, LDAP, AD, Google Account or other\), 4WS.Platform needs user and groups to be provisioned in its repository, because other information are stored within the user account and the authorization inside 4WS.Platform is managed internally.  
There are two options for this to happen:

* manual or automatic user and/or group synchronization from the external source \(doc\)
* automatic user/group provisioning for new users \(doc\)
