Basically, Warp is a series of software layers, one for each application tier, that manage a specific task:

* Warp**.ExtJS** is an extension to the Sencha components ExtJS 3.3.1 and enriches them by providing more powerful features, including:

  * editable grids with multi-sorting, quick filter, persistent storage of last applied settings \(filtering/sorting conditions, columns width, columns position/visibility\), binding to a CRUD buttons palette
  * data export from grid
  * editable detail forms with binding to a CRUD buttons palette
  * code selectors

* Warp**.Rest** is a library to use when developing Restful web services invoked by the ExtJS tier; this layer automates and simplifies the retrieval of data coming from the ExtJS components, such as filtering/sorting conditions, data to and from grids/forms or other graphics components.

* Warp**.Server** is a library used on the server tier to make it easier the development of the business logic, based on JPA or JDBC; it simplifies the fetching of list of objects filtered/sorted according to conditions coming from the Rest/ExtJS tiers.

**WARP** is available through SourceForge portal at this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/warpframework/).
