Through the BPM graphical web designer it is possible to define workflows and use them within the application, for instance to execute complex business logic at certain application events, such as before or after an insert/update/delete of a data object.
This feature avoids the need for custom code to implement complex logic, that can be realized by means of a business process within the BPM engine.
The main features of the BPM module are:

* Web Modeler, embedded into the Platform Web Designer
* BPM engine and Rest API
* Administration and Monitoring Dashboard, providing:

* list of processes and process start
* process executions
* to-do list and manual activities potentially activable per user/group
* Process history



Processes and manual activities can also be binded to application events, without the need to activate them manually using the Dashboard; in this way, a simple event such as a form saving or a grid row saving or a button click can start a process or start/end and activity.
