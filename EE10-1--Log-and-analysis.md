# Log and Analysis

This module is used to monitor an application executed through Platform, from several points of view:

* monitor the **application log** generated on the server-side, like SQL queries, messages generated by server-side javascript actions, etc.
* analyze aggregated data from the application log, in order to  **log**  **statistics**  about server-side operations, such as CPU/memory consumption, HTTP requests
* **analyze the app**  behavior, from different perspectives, including queues and scheduled processes performance, resources consumption, grave misconfigurations, user sessions and threads, etc.
* monitor the **table log** , i.e. server-side log stored in a table and automatically generated for specific events, like javascript or mobile errors, SMS/email sendings, etc.
* **heap memory consumption** , i.e. the amount of memory consumed by the app, in terms of data and metadata; this feature should be used carefully, since it consumes a lot of CPU and disk space and it can be helpful only in case of grave issues related to out of memory errors
* **data audit** , i.e. listening to data writing \(insert, update and delete operations\) defined per table. Once activated that listening for a specified set of tables, Platform automatically records any change internally. After that, you can access to these records through an ad hoc monitor panel, accessible through  **Administration -&gt; Audit** .

This data can be used to identify bottlenecks in the application, misconfigurations or simply to tune the whole system.  
The first 4 functionalities can be accessed from within the Web Designer, through  **Monitoring -&gt;Log and Analysis**  
See the sub-sections for more information about each of these functionalities.
