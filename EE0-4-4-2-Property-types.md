Five different types of properties are supported in Activiti:

* string
* long
* date
* enum
* boolean


 **String** 
Text-field used to store any alphanumeric value

 **Long** 
Text-field used to store any numeric (integer or decimal) value

 **Date** 
Text-field used to store a date/date+time value
In case the date must be formatted with a specific format (e.g. day-month-year rather than month-year-day), a utility method can be used to format it:  **utils.formatDate(&#8230;)** 
This is helpful for instance when a date must be included the body of an email message or in the "documentation" property of a task.

## Example
${utils.formatDate(DATE_VARIABLE)}

or

${utils.formatDate(DATE_VARIABLE,’dd-MM-yyyy’)}

 **Enum** 
An enumeration is a static list of values, feasible to feed a combo-box.
The grid available in the bottom part of the property definition dialog can be used to set this list of values. Both ID and NAME are required.

 **Boolean** 
A Check-box field used to set a "true" or "false" value when selecting/deselecting it.
