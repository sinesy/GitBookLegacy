## Style properties

For a mobile apps, it is possible to define additional style settings, in terms of **shadowing, borders** and **colors**, both for graphics controls and panels.



### Style properties for panels

Styles can be defined starting from the **window definition**: 

* switch to edit mode in the hierarchical representation of the window content

Through it a few settings can be set:

* **Border control** - the type of border to apply the selected panel \(e.g. rounded, no border, etc.\)
* **Border color** - border color for the selected panel 
* **Shadow direction** - in case of a shadow applied to the panel \(i.e. the shadow color has been set\), it defines the shadow direction \(left/right/top/bottom\) 
* **Shadow color** - set the color for a shadow; only if set, the shadow is applied
* **Shadow elevation** - the shadow thickness



### Style properties for controls

In case of form/filter/editable panels where the Constraint layout has been set, it is possible to set style properties for each graphics control.

Once entered the Controls folder in the panel definition, styles can be defined at graphics control level, by switching to **Advanced** mode and clicking on the **Styles** property.
