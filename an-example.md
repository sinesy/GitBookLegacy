# An example

## From theory to practise

Now it is time to move from theory to a real example of how to manage processes through 4WS.Platform, which makes it possible to graphically design a business process and monitor its execution, step by step, until its end.

Letâ€™s start from the Administration -&gt; Activiti menu available in the 4WS.Platform App Designer. This menu is composed of these functionalities, all related to the BPM management:

* [Processes](/EE0-6-2-Processes.md)
* [Instances](/EE0-6-3-Instances.md)
* [Activities](/EE0-6-4-Activities.md)
* [History](/EE0-6-5-History.md)
