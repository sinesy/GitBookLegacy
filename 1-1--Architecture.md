Since each organization has its own identity management, 4WS.Platform has been designed with a default open source implementation of an identity management, that can be replaced with another one of your choice.
That can be done easily, due to the pluggable nature of the platform: the default identity management implementation provided with 4WS.Platform is a plugin that can be replaced with something else, created ad hoc for a specific company.
The default implementation includes an authentication process based on a predefined database table or through the LDAP protocol.
Authorizations and menu definition are also managed by predefined database tables, which can be replaced by other implementations, if needed.
