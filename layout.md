**Panel containers and layouts**  
Platform supports a variety of different  **panel containers** , each managing the layout of its children panels in a different way:

* [tab panel](/layout/tab-panel.md)
* [alternative panes](/layout/alternative-panel.md)
* [accordion panel](/layout/accordion-panel.md)
* [vertical orientation panel](/layout/vertical-orientation-panel.md)
* [horizontal orientation panel](/layout/horizontal-orientation-panel.md)
* [table panel](/layout/table-panel.md)
* [generic panel](/layout/ggeneric-panel.md)
* [responsive panel](/layout/responsive-panel.md)

Each of them is described as follow.  
Note: you can easily change the current panel container with another one, without having to remove its content and then remove it: the commands “Replace this panel with…” allow you to replace the current panel container with any other.
