# Models

Starting from the processes window, it is possible to access to another window containing the list of BPMN models.  
A model is an editable version of a process and it can be changed any number of times, through the  **web modeler** .  
A process represent a runnable version of a model and cannot be edited.  
Therefore, the lifecycle starts with a model created using the web modeler, then the model is converted in a process; once a process is available, it can be started any number of times. The model can be changed and follows a separated flow; at some point, it can be converted in a new version of the process.  
**Once a process has been created starting from a model, an "** automatic form creation **" task is carried out. This task analyzes the process definition, searching for manual tasks and their linked properties: for each of them, a Platform detail form is created and filled in with the task properties. **  
In this way, you can embed these forms in any other window and manage the showable part of the process as any other Platform UI.
