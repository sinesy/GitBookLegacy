# Processes

This window shows the  **processes**  list that are currently defined and, for each process, its current version and the graphical representation of the model.  
The same window allows to start a process, that is to say, a process instance is created when the user presses the "start" button.   
If the process definition requires a set of properties in order to start it, these are showed and checked out just before the process instance creation.Other available actions are:  
importing of an existing BPMN process \(via XML files or BPMN\); once imported the file, a new  **process model**  will be created.  
exporting of a process definition, in XML format; this operation is useful in case you want to deploy a process from an environment to another.  
duplication of a process definition, helpful for instance to create a branch of an already existing and running process.
