4WS.Platform has been designed to work with already existing tables: the powerful reverse engineering feature makes very easy and fast the definition of data models and business components first, and then the creation of grid and detail panels, starting from models, relations and business components.
However, this is not the only way to work with 4WS.Platform: it is also possible to define tables inside the product: "Tables" menu item allows the creation of a table in a graphical way: after specifying the table name, it is possible to add fields to that table, including field type, mandatory settings and primary keys.

Consequently, it is always possible to start from an empty schema and create tables, models and so forth.
