# Customizations

The GUI of the mobile app can be customized at three levels:  
through  **custom**   **images**  to provide when deploying the app and required by the chosen mobile platform \(iOS or Android\)  
using the App Designer  **custom theme editor** , which allows the user to customize font, foreground and background colors for the graphics components supported in the mobile GUI  
using the App Designer to choose a  **menu type**  and organize its content.

Moreover, the business and presentation logic of the mobile app can be customized through the events management and the support for javascript actions: similarly to what happens with web interpreted applications, the App Designer allows the user to define javascript actions and bind them to application events.

Finally, the app menu can be presented in different layouts:  
tab bar  
icons  
slide menu  
no menu, in case the app has a main page which represents the starting point of the whole app; the other windows can be accessed starting from that window, through row click or button clicks.
