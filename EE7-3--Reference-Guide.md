# Reference guide



When defining a new mobile app through the App Designer, there are a few settings to set in the "**Configuration**" panel. This panel is the same used when defining a web application. Among them, there are a few mandatory fields to set:

* **app id**
* **description**
* **context path mobile** - this subfolder is used to include static content to pass to the mobile app, such as images, documents, etc.
* **context path web** - this subfolder will be used only by the corresponding web application opened starting from the Platform home page; this web application is typically used only to define users and roles for the mobile app

Apart from the main settings defined in the "Configuration" panel, there two additional panels you can use to set further settings for a mobile app:

* "**Mobile**" - this panel includes settings that are specific for a mobile app and not shown when defining a web app
* "**Events**" - this panel includes events at app level \(not related to panels or components...\), that are specific for a mobile app and not shown when defining a web app

In the following sections, the Mobile and Events panels are described more in depth.
