# Mobile Introduction

The 4WS.Platform â€“ Mobile edition can operate with iOS and Android devices, both on tablet and smartphones.  
Any number of mobile apps can be created starting from a single installation of Platform.  
This solution is composed of:  
a ** server-side Platform installation** , containing the Enterprise Mobile module able to communicate with the Platform Mobile apps  
a  **mobile app** , which consists of an interpreter created once for iOS and Android, which communicates with the server side to receive the metadata needed to define the behavior of the app \(both GUI, business logic and data structures\). Once received this metadata, the app is ready to work and can synchronize with the server side to invoke web services, send or receive data and files.
