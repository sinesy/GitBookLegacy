# Setting up the environment

In order to connect to Mongo DB, you have first to install it and make it accessible to a Platform installation.  
You can find a free downloadable installation at this link:

[https://www.mongodb.org/downloads](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

Once installed the NoSQL database, you can access it from Platform after configuring the Mongo DB connection settings through the global parameters of Platform-  
The required parameter is the host name of Mongo DB database. All other parameters are optional and they depend on the specific installation and security settings defined when configuring the Mongo DB instance.

Once done that, you can start creating collections \(i.e. the equivalent of the relational tables\), defining enquiries using the Mongo DB query language, creating panels connected to these components and manage all reading and writing operations involved with the panes.
