A dynamic combo-box is very similar to a lookup: in both cases a list of codes is retrieved by calling a business component on the server side.
Anyway, there are two main differences between them:
 **combo-box**   → show one only column (description)
 **lookup grid →**  can show any number of columns
 **combo-box**  → mustn&#8217;t be used to fetch a great degree of values (web app will crash on the client side)
 **lookup grid**  → no limit in the number of items
Therefore, it is essential not to use combo-boxes when the number of items exceeds a few hundreds of records.
