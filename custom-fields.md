# Custom Fields

In a multi-company environment 4WS.Platform allows you to create custom fields in each object.

Fields added to the object are also physically created in the associated database table. It is possible to create fields of type text, number with or without decimals, and date with or without the time.

The new custom fields are associated with the company id of the user who creates them and can be used by all the applications enabled to the same company.

Once the field is created, this is managed by 4WS.Platform as a normal database field so it can be used in the component business, in the panels and even in translations.

All custom fields created will be visible in the panels, but only those with the same company of the logged in user will be editable.
